Habits reflection:

 I have definitely had a noticeable improvement in getting sucked into a problem and spending too much time on it. I have noticed my energy is better from taking more poms, and I am solving complex problems faster and with less faffing. I have been trying to include more retrospective time while working, and I have found that to also be helpful.
 
 Beginner's Mind:
 
  Honestly, I have always thought about how learning is often easiest at the beginning of a process. There is a phrase that I use to keep myself in check, not only with how I act, but also how I approach difficult situations: "Be childlike, not childish." To me this contains the idea of the beginners mind - that there is so much to try, and to keep trying and learning with unerring optimism, but also to understand that frustration is not a thing to embody personally.

  _Strengths:_
  
  My biggest strengths have to do with my interpersonal skills, which is exactly what makes a good software developer. The more I see about coding, programming, or whatever you want to call this gigantic industry, the more I recognize that the skills I came in with from my careers in arts, education, and client-facing trades, are almost more important than technical proficiencies. Technical skills can be learned, while interpersonal skills and the inclusion of important collaborative habits, and the real bread and butter of being a productive and supportive team member.
  
 In this last week, I have looked back at my vision statement, and I am content with it. It is not all encompassing in terms of how I will work, but if I have learned anything from Turing so far, it is to stay with healthy work habits, and I can learn everything else as long as I keep running. The important parts are, to repeat last week's vision statement:
 working with a group of friendly supportive people, from whom I will continue learning, and with whom I will be happy to work. I will have health insurance, and a salary that allows me to help those around me without question. The work that I am doing will not be harmful to anyone.
