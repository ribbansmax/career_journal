1. What is challenging about self-reflection? How can you continue to build the habit of self-reflection at Turing?

 Self-reflection is not fun. As someone who phases in and out of self-confidence, self-reflection necesitates the process that I often try to not awknowledge for my own sake- namely self-directed critical thinking. And even though self reflection is not necessarily critical in the sense of criticism, it still invites those thoughts. As far as building the habit of self-reflection, I think the most useful (and by that I mean the most likely that I will continue it) method will be to do some self reflection every day, at a specific time, while doing something else I enjoy.
 
I always value:
* communication
* fun
* dignity
* creativity
* relational justice (justice is too targetted a word for me to feel comfortable saying it without caveats.)

I often value:
* location
* humor
* relaxation
* authenticity
* patience

I sometimes value:
* determination
* responsibility
* pressure
* aesthetics
* elegance

I seldom value:
* obedience
* career
* legacy
* ambition

Good, worthwhile work is not about the end result. Anything worth doing, is worth doing for the process. I strongly believe that anything created through a bad process is not worth doing. There is another way. Good, worthwhile work is fullfilling first and foremost. The results of the work should be positive as well, but the process comes first.

As far as my lifeview, in brief; I subscribe to the belief of relational care. 

My views on work and life are aligned. Simply put: my views on life drive how I work, why I work, and when I work. I do not see a difference between how my work intentions interact with my intentions.
