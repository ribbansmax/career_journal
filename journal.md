When you've worked towards a goal in the past, what systems or tools have been helpful for you in accomplishing that goal? How could you adapt those same systems/tools to use while at Turing?

  The biggest thing for myself is staying organized, especially in terms of my larger picture. By that I mean not losing sight of the end goals that I have. I often set myself soft deadlines, depending upon my understanding of what my work timeline looks like, and then I reassess as I hit that deadline.

As you start this new career, what is one of your strengths and how do you know?

  One of my strengths is my ability to have long sessions of intense focus. Coming from a background of film editing, I am used to sitting and figuring out intricate details of a larger project for hours at a time.

Describe how you work best (conditions, environment, preferences, etc.):

  I work best when I am coworking with somebody else, if only to bounce ideas off of each other. It does not have to be someone involved in the same project as me, they just have to help ground me in my longterm organization. 

As you start this new career, what is your greatest area of improvement when it comes to your professional skills?

  I have always been less than ideal at self marketing. I am content to work for long periods of time, but my description of the work that I have done tends to be quite lacking.

How will developing a deeper understanding of your strengths and working preferences benefit you as a software developer?

  Similar to the discussion I had about empathy, the methods in which people work are the scaffolding for how happy they are, and how efficiently they can work with themselves and with a wider team.

Describe the vision you currently have for your career after Turing:

  Honestly, I do not have an idea for what that looks like at the moment. All I know is that I like coding, and I like problem solving, and I think that those fit well into a career in development. I deally I would like to be a part of a smallish team, working on something that helps other people. That is broad enough as to be wholly unhelpful, but I have always subscribed to the belief that I am much better at choosing what I do not want to do than what I do want to do.
