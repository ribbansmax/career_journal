1. What are some traits of a good software developer?

 A good software developer is someone that is approachable, not just personally, but also coding-wise. They are not presumptive, nor attached to any code in particular. They see code not only as a means to create projects, but also as a means to communicate with the people who come after them.
 
 As a software developer, I want to be someone who is not code focused. Code is the language through which we communicate, but it is not the words we speak. By that I mean that it is simply the vehicle we use to articulate what we are actually trying to say. I want to be soeone who can be as clear with my code as I can be with my words. A good way to improve that relationship with code is to keep trying new ways to articulate methods, etc... Like with words, it is good to practice many ways to say something so that whenn someone has a preference for learning, it is not an entirely new method of 'speaking.' A good habit to get into will be to revisit old code, and try and do the same thing in a different way. I think the between mods breaks will be a good time to look back over old code, and not just remmeber and learn from retrospect, but also to look at it with the eyes of communicating in a different way.
 
2. Habits:

 One thing I have been working on is my ability to focus on big-picture programming instead of getting caught in writing method after method. A way that I have been conditioning myself to become more aware of this during the Futbol project has been by thinking about integration and abstraction after writing every method. This has led me to understand more how the just completed method fits into the whole project, instead of tunnelling into just what it accomplishes in that moment. Another way to enforce this that I can pick up would be to enforce poms more regularly around methods- just having that break before diving back in can really excentuate the break, and prevent leaping too far ahead of the path.

1. What is challenging about self-reflection? How can you continue to build the habit of self-reflection at Turing?

 Self-reflection is not fun. As someone who phases in and out of self-confidence, self-reflection necesitates the process that I often try to not awknowledge for my own sake- namely self-directed critical thinking. And even though self reflection is not necessarily critical in the sense of criticism, it still invites those thoughts. As far as building the habit of self-reflection, I think the most useful (and by that I mean the most likely that I will continue it) method will be to do some self reflection every day, at a specific time, while doing something else I enjoy.
 
I always value:
* communication
* fun
* dignity
* creativity
* relational justice (justice is too targetted a word for me to feel comfortable saying it without caveats.)

I often value:
* location
* humor
* relaxation
* authenticity
* patience

I sometimes value:
* determination
* responsibility
* pressure
* aesthetics
* elegance

I seldom value:
* obedience
* career
* legacy
* ambition

Good, worthwhile work is not about the end result. Anything worth doing, is worth doing for the process. I strongly believe that anything created through a bad process is not worth doing. There is another way. Good, worthwhile work is fullfilling first and foremost. The results of the work should be positive as well, but the process comes first.

As far as my lifeview, in brief; I subscribe to the belief of relational care. 

My views on work and life are aligned. Simply put: my views on life drive how I work, why I work, and when I work. I do not see a difference between how my work intentions interact with my intentions. 

_Week1_

1. Describe one of your strengths:

I can follow logical statements quickly and accurately. I know how to interpret most methods of logical steps. I am able to communicate logical statements accurately and clearly. This all combines into a strength where I am able to clearly catch someone up on the work that I have done.

2. Read through your Top 4 results from Pairin:

 My Pairin resuts tell me that I am very much influenced by the people around me, and want to make sure that we are all on the same page. I want the work that I am doing to be beneficial to others, and for it to help people. This does resonate with me - it is how I would describe myself, both in terms of my methods of thinking and for the sources that drive me. This is very similar to the strength I wrote about above.
 
 
3. Challenges with strengths

 One of the tricky things about recognizing my strengths is in analyzing the method that I work from a third perspective. I think the best way to work through that, and practice that skill, is by doing this career journal. Constantly answering these kind of questions is a good thing to develop that skill!
 One strength I do see myself overusing is my ability to hyperfocus in on a task. This can sometimes let me lose track of other work I should be doing. A good method for fixing this is the pomodoro (sp?) method, because then every 45, 50 minutes or so I can take a break and maybe breathe and not feel like I have to stay so intensely focused on what I have been working on.
 
4. Strengths in action

 I like to talk through my ideas when I am working. I also like deadlines, if only to ignore them because they are arbitrary, and most useful only for motivation to begin work.
 As far as describing these working preferences go, I would say that my preferences fit into most scaffolds of 'having a pla' even if I am not the biggest proponent of sticking to the plan word for word.
 As far as what I need to be aware of when working with other people, I think I need to make sure that there are regularly scheduled methods of communication, because all plans change, and I can be quick to take things in a different path if it seems better, and those are the type of directions that necessitate communication.
 My Pairin results accurately depict my drive to intuitively work, but also to not be a lone wolf.
 
 5. Continued growth
 
  An area I would like to sharpen is my skill in self-promotion, or at least self-strength-expression.
  One step, in addition to this journal, would be to constantly ask for feedback on my work, and not just consturctive feedback, but also feedback more along the lines of how I chose to approach the work. (also, not in terms of fishing for compliments, but just to get more examples of how other people would frame the thing I am doing, because in the past I have been bad at wording my own strengths.)
 

_Mod0:_
When you've worked towards a goal in the past, what systems or tools have been helpful for you in accomplishing that goal? How could you adapt those same systems/tools to use while at Turing?

  The biggest thing for myself is staying organized, especially in terms of my larger picture. By that I mean not losing sight of the end goals that I have. I often set myself soft deadlines, depending upon my understanding of what my work timeline looks like, and then I reassess as I hit that deadline.

As you start this new career, what is one of your strengths and how do you know?

  One of my strengths is my ability to have long sessions of intense focus. Coming from a background of film editing, I am used to sitting and figuring out intricate details of a larger project for hours at a time.

Describe how you work best (conditions, environment, preferences, etc.):

  I work best when I am coworking with somebody else, if only to bounce ideas off of each other. It does not have to be someone involved in the same project as me, they just have to help ground me in my longterm organization. 

As you start this new career, what is your greatest area of improvement when it comes to your professional skills?

  I have always been less than ideal at self marketing. I am content to work for long periods of time, but my description of the work that I have done tends to be quite lacking.

How will developing a deeper understanding of your strengths and working preferences benefit you as a software developer?

  Similar to the discussion I had about empathy, the methods in which people work are the scaffolding for how happy they are, and how efficiently they can work with themselves and with a wider team.

Describe the vision you currently have for your career after Turing:

  Honestly, I do not have an idea for what that looks like at the moment. All I know is that I like coding, and I like problem solving, and I think that those fit well into a career in development. I deally I would like to be a part of a smallish team, working on something that helps other people. That is broad enough as to be wholly unhelpful, but I have always subscribed to the belief that I am much better at choosing what I do not want to do than what I do want to do.
