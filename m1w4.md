1. How have you seen yourself become more aware of your habits? Have you tried implementing anything new? What have the results been?

 I have definitely become more resilient to rushing through planning. I have seen and experienced how planning is integral to succesful coding, and in having experience as well as practice developing habits, I can convince myself to stick with it. So the results have been good! I have gamed my working habits to become more productive, and as a result a better and more communicative coder.
 
2. How would you rate your overall health on a scale of 1-5? How do you currently make time for activities associated with your health? What is a small change you could make here to readjust your health ratings?

 I would rate my health at the moment as a 3. I am for sure not at my worst, and I am actively trying to protect my health and wellbeing, however, the US sucks. I could go into that more, but honestly ity is better not to. I am making sure that I am continuing doing things that make me happy, and I am still excited and driven to be working hard on Turing, expecially since it has been awhile since I have been able to do meaningful wor during the pandemic. Something that I could do that would make my health rating better: maybe be more honest with myself about time management. I like to convince myself that things do not take as long as they actually do...
 
3. Make a short list of all the ways you work right now; How much value do each of those things bring to your life? How are those activities purposeful for you?

 My work right now includes: keeping track and on top of my, my family's, and my friends'. health and needs; Turing; and general living things. They all bring meaning to my life, in different ways. They all are fulfilling, in that it is important and often fun work, even if the surrounding context of them, i.e. pandemic or late-night project work, is not the ideal situation.
 
4. Play & Love:

 This one I will be brief about, because I am lucky enough at the moment that pretty much all of the work that I do, as mentioned above, gives me joy. I also very much subscribe to the belief that non-harmful hedonism is a very good thing. I am surrounded, if not physically, by people and things I love and am loved by.
 
5. Growth:

 By the end of the Turing program, I would love to have continued my capabilities with balancing joy, work, and health, while adding methods to accomplish growth within those areas. At the moment my use for programming is work/time based, and in future with the job hunt, my goal is to continue treating coding as I have so far at Turing. Namely: it is fun, fulfilling, and provides a context to work with friendly, helpful, and wellmeaning people.
 
6. Group discussion:

 Most of our discussion centered on how software development is too broad of a category to adequately generalize, and the work related to it is important to us as individuals because of three main reasons. 1: who we are working with, and the style of team collaboration. None of us will accept a poor work environment. A consensus about why we are at Turing is to give us more options with how and where to work. 2: The health insurance and monetary benefits of working in tech cannot be understated. It is a real drive that is lacking in so many industries in the US. 3: How what we will be working on helps other people. There is always a choice, and having a technical skillset will provide more of a choice than not having that skillset. 
 
Vision:

 After Turing, I will be working with a group of friendly supportive people, from whom I will continue learning, and with whom I will be happy to work. I will have health insurance, and a salary that allows me to help those around me without question. The work that I am doing will not be harmful to anyone.
