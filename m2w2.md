Assess your habits from week 1: how did you spend your time this past week? What was effective in your habits? What could be more effective? What steps will you take to make that happen?

Write a draft of your professional story here as 1-2 paragraphs. Focus on answering the questions who are you, why are you here, and whatâ€™s next? Consider how to talk about your motives and values, the turning points that led to your career change, and what you envision for yourself going forward.

I come from a background of live circus performance where I would work between the realms of an artist and a filmmaker, translating artists' visions into film. So many of our stories and projects can be limited by the mediums through which they are portrayed, and I work to help other people's work shine. 

I bring the technical knowledge to folks who need someone to help make their ideas a reality. My background in navigating the application of experiences and stories into logical and formulaic models without losing the heart of those ideas drives my desire to become a better software developer.

What other steps will you take this week to update your branding or practice your story?

Communicating with other folks and hearing their stories gives me a good basis for the style and language I should use to present mine.
